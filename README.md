   Please follow the instructions below :
   Make the screen as per design (Spin the Wheel) - it does not need to be exact - but close enough is Accepted .
 - Make the object spin when the button is clicked.
-  Make the object stop Spinning after 1-10 seconds (use 1+ Math.random() *10 for setInterval)
-  display the angle of the spin stop in the console.log output.
